# RandomUser_iOS_VIPER
A small app to demonstrate the VIPER architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) for the networking, [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher), [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) and [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for the images, [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) for the persistence, [Hero](https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero) andÂ [SkeletonView](https://github.com/Juanpe/SkeletonView) for the transitions, and [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) for the animations. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with .storyboard files (UIKit) and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple VIPER architectural pattern in practice. If you are interested you can take a look at my other repos as well.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
