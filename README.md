# RandomUser_iOS_VIPER
A small app to demonstrate the VIPER architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance Alamofire for the networking (it can be replaced by a Moya layer if you are interested), Kingfisher for the images, Hero for the transitions, and Realm for the persistence. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with .storyboard files (UIKit) and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple VIPER architectural pattern in practice.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
